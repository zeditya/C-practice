# C Practice: Self-Learning Journey

Welcome! This repository is my personal space to practice C programming and track my progress as I learn the language. Here you'll find simple exercises, example programs, and notes that help reinforce my understanding of C concepts.

The aim is to grow from basics to more complex ideas at my own pace. All code here is for personal use, reflection, and experimentation.
